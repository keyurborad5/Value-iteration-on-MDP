# Solving MDP using Value Iteration

<div style="text-align: justify;">
A Markov decision process (MDP) refers to a stochastic decision-making process that uses a mathematical framework to model the decision-making of a dynamic system. It is used in scenarios where the results are either random or controlled by a decision maker, which makes sequential decisions over time. MDPs evaluate which actions the decision maker should take STRICTLY considering the current state and environment of the system.

MDPs are independent of the HISTORY of the states it has previously visited to reach at the current state and the decision for next action is independent of it.
